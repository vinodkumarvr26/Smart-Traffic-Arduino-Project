Excited to share that our first-year engineering project, “𝐄𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐕𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐥𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥-𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜 𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧,” was selected among the 𝐓𝐨𝐩 70 teams out of 576 teams in our college!
In our first year of engineering, I had the incredible project focused on a real and urgent problem: reducing delays for emergency vehicles stuck in traffic.
Our system aimed to prioritize ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles at intersections by intelligently managing traffic signals in real time. 
Using Arduino-based technology, we developed a system that could dynamically manage traffic flow and give priority to emergency vehicles at intersections. The goal was clear: save time and potentially save lives.
This wasn’t just a college assignment — it was a chance to:
✔️ Work on a solution with real-life relevance
✔️ Lead a passionate and driven team
✔️ Gain hands-on experience with embedded systems
✔️ See our project recognized among the Top 70 teams in the college

This experience gave us hands-on exposure to real-world problem-solving, teamwork, and innovation early in our academic journey. Grateful for the learning, growth, and recognition!
